# Source-Code_Portfolio-React
This page shows the source code for yasol123/github.io
You can download and take a look what I have done for the project.

1. the website actually is composed of a single HTML page.
2. However, I utilized react-router-dom for rendering multiple "pages" in a single page.
3. I also used email-js API for "Contact Me" page.
4. The portfolio website will be updated regularly.
